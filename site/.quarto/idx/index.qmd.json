Our objective is to provide scientific and technical support on the monitoring of air quality, air sampling and analysis of (bio)aerosols, both from indoor and outdoor environments. The AIRLAB offers a wide range of services, ranging from the peformance evaluation of air quality sensors, to the cultivation and DNA extraction of airborne microorganisms (e.g. bacteria and fungi) for their downstream characterisation and identification by next-generation sequencing techniques.\nThe AIRLAB is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments and has different areas, one for microbiological cultures, another for molecular biology analysis, the other for chemical analysis, as well as a microscopy room. \n\n## What is does the AIRLAB offer?\n\nThe AIRLAB offers technical and methodological assessment to ISGlobal research projects and to external research groups. ISGlobal researchers can also use the AIRLAB facilities upon request.\n\nServices provided include:\n\n- Processing of air samples\n- Extraction and quantification of DNA from air samples\n- Cultivation of microorganisms from air samples\n- Evaluation of air quality sensors\n- Analysis of air quality data\n- Scientific advice and technical support\n- Fluorescence microscopy (autoservice)\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"cosmo","title":"AIRLAB","subtitle":"An ISGlobal facility"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
